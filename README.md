This repo shows good practise on 
* python coding
* object oriented programming

It implements a technical test described in test_instruction.pdf

Modules (Python implementation):
* reader.py : reads mower settings from instruction file
* motion.py : motion catalog, implements mower motions
* state.py : state module, specifies mower position and orientation - this class could be implemented
in mower module as well
* mower.py : mower module, manages mower motion
* main : launch test

To launch the test:
```
python main.py
```
